                Nice to meet you! My name is Simone Stradiotto, born July/15
                /1999 in Italy, where I currently live. The first three
                adjectives that come to my mind in order to describe myself are
                curious, stubborn and constant. That said, however, the best
                thing to say in order to describe me is that I love to read and
                learn.

                I spent countless hours just reading about all kind of things:
                history, nature, space, technology and science. Usually it's
                just my curiosity to drive me, but of course there have been
                times where I needed some specific information for me or for my
                family. In that occasions I understand that my curiosity, in the
                course of many years, passively helped me to
                <span class="biography__span"> learn how to learn. </span>
                All of this thanks to the fact that we live in the greatest time
                in the entire history to learn new things.

                During my adventures on the Internet, I came across a famous
                quote from the author and public speaker Donald Miller:
                <span class="biography__span">
                  &ldquo;In the age of information, ignorance is a
                  choice.&rdquo;
                </span>
                I deeply agree with this statement.

                this possibility.

                I believe that now it can no longer be denied: as humans, we
                have greatly damaged our biosphere. Unfortunately, until
                recently, many people did not see climate changes as a serious
                and immediate problem. That being said, it gives me hope to see
                how in recent years, many companies have undergone a process of
                awareness, trying to reduce their environmental impact. Much of
                this has been possible thanks to the digital revolution.

                Thanks to it, our species in the last hundred years has been

                I grew up and live in a country house. I remember when I was a
                child, I liked to go out in our garden on summer evenings and
                observe the fireflies. For several years now the fireflies are
                no more. It's a very personal example, but it was when I noticed
                this little thing that I realized how easy it is to pass over or
                even not notice some ecosystem losses. In this area too, digital
                can help raise public awareness of this kind of facts.

                finish learning, but that's just fine for me.

                  &ldquo;The Poppy War&rdquo; is an historical fantasy published
                  in 2018. It's a fantasy repurposing of the second
                  sino-japanese war (1937–1945), and it also deals with various
                  aspects of Mongolian and Chinese shamanism. I must warn you,
                  however, that it is a book that deals with war in a very raw
                  way, and I do not recommend it if you are easily
                  impressionable.

                  are not biologically correct I can't help but adore this
                  movie. It also has an incredible amount of memorable scenes:
                  the velociraptors chasing the kids in the kitchen, the quote

                    Videogames have always been an important part of my life. I
                    know that they are a hobby that is very often demonized and
                    passed off as a waste of time, but I consider them a form of
                    art. I do not pretend to change anyone's opinion, I only ask
                    to be open to new forms of expression.

                  With &ldquo;The Legend of Zelda&rdquo;'s series I was unable
                  to choose a single game. They are a series of fantastic puzzle
                  and action games that have made the history of the medium. The
                  developers have also shown a lot of courage and imagination
                  over and over again, as each chapter of the saga is absolutely
                  unique.

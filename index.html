                Nice to meet you! My name is Simone Stradiotto, born July/15
                /1999 in Italy, where I currently live. The first three
                adjectives that come to my mind in order to describe myself are
                curious, stubborn and constant. That said, however, the best
                thing to say in order to describe me is that I love to read and
                learn.

                I spent countless hours just reading about all kind of things:
                history, nature, space, technology and science. Usually it's
                just my curiosity to drive me, but of course there have been
                times where I needed some specific information for me or for my
                family. In that occasions I understand that my curiosity, in the
                course of many years, passively helped me to
                <span class="biography__span"> learn how to learn. </span>
                All of this thanks to the fact that we live in the greatest time
                in the entire history to learn new things.

                During my adventures on the Internet, I came across a famous
                quote from the author and public speaker Donald Miller:

                  &ldquo;In the age of information, ignorance is a
                  choice.&rdquo;

                I deeply agree with this statement.

                human could learn in a lifetime. Well, I'm not going to waste
                this possibility.

                I believe that now it can no longer be denied: as humans, we
                have greatly damaged our biosphere. Unfortunately, until
                recently, many people did not see climate changes as a serious
                and immediate problem. That being said, it gives me hope to see
                how in recent years, many companies have undergone a process of
                awareness, trying to reduce their environmental impact. Much of
                this has been possible thanks to the digital revolution.

                Thanks to it, our species in the last hundred years has been

                I grew up and live in a country house. I remember when I was a
                child, I liked to go out in our garden on summer evenings and
                observe the fireflies. For several years now the fireflies are
                no more. It's a very personal example, but it was when I noticed
                this little thing that I realized how easy it is to pass over or
                even not notice some ecosystem losses. In this area too, digital
                can help raise public awareness of this kind of facts.

                finish learning, but that's just fine for me.

                    I absolutely LOVE CSS. Sometimes I like to go see some CSS
                    codepen, and I'm always amazed at what can be achieved with
                    only that technology. So, in my sites, I always try to make
                    something cool exploiting the potential of the modern CSS. I
                    also like to use the BEM metodology for classes, which
                    really helps with the DRY mentality.

                    If the app I'm working on is big enough, I really like to
                    use SASS, expetially with SCSS syntax. It helps not only to
                    speed up the process, but also to keep the code really
                    organized. I'm particulary a fan of the 7-in-1 architecture.

                    I'm also pretty confident using JavaScript. Everything that

                    and I believe that this can really make or break a web app.
                    Even if I can understand well the old code, I'm more at ease
                    with post ES2015 syntax.

                    I don't like unforseens, but since they are inevitable in
                    life I decided to plan everything else. I even try to
                    schedule my dayly routine in order to be able to deal with
                    as much unexpected events as possible. This could sound a

                    that opportunity to enhance my communication as much as I
                    can. Again, if I can improve then I take every opportunity.

                  &ldquo;The Poppy War&rdquo; is an historical fantasy published
                  in 2018. It's a fantasy repurposing of the second
                  sino-japanese war (1937–1945), and it also deals with various
                  aspects of Mongolian and Chinese shamanism. I must warn you,
                  however, that it is a book that deals with war in a very raw
                  way, and I do not recommend it if you are easily
                  impressionable.

                    Soundtracks are by far my favorite kind of music. I started

                    passionate about orchestral music in general, and no other
                    type of music manages to give me similar feelings.

                  Sky however, at least for me, has a little something extra. I
                  can't really define what, I just know that every time I listen

                    Thanks to my dad, I started watching many of the great
                    classics of cinema very early. From &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;
                    to &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo;, I've seen films of all kinds
                    and I've always found very fascinated how much our culture
                    has been and still is influenced by movies, even in everyday
                    life.
